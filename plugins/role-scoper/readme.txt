CMS-like permissions for reading and editing. Content-specific restrictions and roles supplement/override WordPress roles. User groups optional.

== Description ==

Role Scoper is a comprehensive access control solution, giving you CMS-like control of reading and editing permissions.  Assign restrictions and roles to specific pages, posts or categories.  For WP 2.7 to 2.9, use [Role Scoper 1.2.x](http://agapetry.net/downloads/role-scoper_legacy).

<strong>Role Scoper has a big brother!</strong> Are you interested in a friendlier UI, cleaner restriction model with WP Roles integration, custom Visibility and Moderation statuses, bbPress content roles, BuddyPress role groups and professional support? Step up to <a href='http://presspermit.com'>Press Permit</a>.

= How it works: =
Your WordPress core role definitions remain unchanged, and continue to function as default permissions.  User access is altered only as you expand it by assigning content-specific roles, or reduce it by setting content-specific restrictions.

Users of any level can be elevated to read or edit content of your choice.  Restricted content can be withheld from users lacking a content-specific role, regardless of their WP role.  Deactivation or removal of Role Scoper will return each user to their standard WordPress access (but all RS settings remain harmlessly in the database in case you change your mind).

Scoped role restrictions and assignments are reflected in every aspect of the WordPress interface, from front end content and navigation to administrative post and comment totals.  Although Role Scoper provides extreme flexibility and powerful bulk administration forms, basic usage is just a set of user checkboxes in the Post/Page Edit Form.

= Partial Feature List =
* WP roles work as is or can be limited by content-specific Restrictions
* RS roles grant additional Read or Edit access for specific Pages, Posts or Categories
* Define User Groups and give them one or more RS roles
* Can elevate Subscribers to edit desired content (ensures safe failure mode)
* Control which categories users can post to
* Control which pages users can associate sub-pages to
* Specify element(s) in Edit Form to withhold from non-Editors
* Grant Read or Edit access for a limited time duration
* Limit the post/page publish dates which a role assignment applies to
* Customizable Hidden Content Teaser (or hide posts/pages completely) 
* RSS Feed Filter with HTTP authentication option
* File Attachment filter blocks direct URL requests if user can't read corresponding post/page
* Inheritance of Restrictions and Roles to sub-categories / sub-pages
* Default Restrictions and Roles for new content
* Un-editable posts are excluded from the Edit Posts/Pages list
* Optimized to limit additional database queries
* XML-RPC support
* Integrates with the [Revisionary plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/revisionary/) for moderated revisioning of published content.
* Supports custom Post Types and Taxonomies (when defined using WP schema by a plugin such as [Custom Post Type UI](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/) 
* Extensive WP-mu support

= Plugin API =
* Abstract architecture and API allow other plugins to define their own data/taxonomy schema and role definitions
* Author provides some [extensions to support integration with other plugins](http://agapetry.net/category/plugins/role-scoper/role-scoper-extensions/)

= Template Functions =
Theme code can utilize the is&#95;restricted&#95;rs() and is&#95;teaser&#95;rs() functions to customize front-end styling.

Other useful functions include users&#95;who&#95;can(), which accounts for all content-specific roles and restrictions.

For more information, see the [Usage Guide](http://agapetry.net/downloads/RoleScoper_UsageGuide.htm) or [Support Forum](http://agapetry.net/forum/).

= Support =
* Most Bug Reports and Plugin Compatibility issues addressed promptly following your [support forum](http://agapetry.net/forum/) submission.
* Author is available for professional consulting to meet your configuration, troubleshooting and customization needs.

== Installation ==

Role Scoper can be installed automatically via the Plugins tab in your blog administration panel.

= To install manually instead: =
1. Upload `role-scoper&#95;?.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Extract `role-scoper&#95;?.zip` into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I prevent low-level users from seeing the Roles/Restrictions menus and Edit boxes? =

In your blog admin, navigate to Roles > Options.  In the "Content Maintenance" section, set the option "Roles and Restrictions can be set" to "by blog-wide Editors and Administrators" or "by Administrators only".  Click the Update button.

= How does Role Scoper compare to Role Manager or [Capability Manager](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/capsman/)? =

Role Scoper's functionality is entirely different and complementary to RM and CM.  RM/CM do little more than alter WordPress' definition of the capabilities included in each role.  That's a valuable task, and in many cases will be all the role customization you need.  Since RM/CM modifications are stored in the main WordPress database, they remain even if RM/CM is deactivated.

Role Scoper is useful when you want to customize access to specific content, not just blog-wide.  It will work with the WP roles as a starting point, whether customized by RM/CM or not.  To see how Role Scoper's role definitions correlate to your WordPress roles, navigate to Roles > Options > RS Role Definitions in your blog admin.  Role Scoper's modifications remain only while it stays active.

= Why are there so many options? Do I really need Role Scoper? =

It depends on what you're trying to accomplish with your WordPress installation.  Role Scoper is designed to be functionally comprehensive and flexible.  Great pains were taken to maintain performance and user-friendliness.  Yet there are simpler permission plugins out there, particularly if you only care about read access.  Review Role Scoper's feature list and decide what's important to you.

= Why doesn't Role Scoper limit direct access to files that I've uploaded via FTP? =

Role Scoper only filters files in the WP uploads folder (or a subfolder).  The uploads folder must be a branch of the WordPress directory tree.  The files must be formally attached to a post / page via the WordPress uploader or via the RS Attachments Utility.

In your blog admin, navigate to Roles > Options > Features > Attachments > Attachments Utility.

= Where does Role Scoper store its settings?  How can I completely remove it from my database? =

Role Scoper creates and uses the following tables: groups&#95;rs, user2group&#95;rs, role&#95;scope&#95;rs, user2role2object&#95;rs.  All RS-specific options stored to the WordPress options table have an option name prefixed with "scoper&#95;".

Due to the potential damage incurred by accidental deletion, no automatic removal is currently available.  You can use a SQL editing tool such as phpMyAdmin to drop the tables and delete the scoper options.

= With the launch of Press Permit as a professional equivalent, is Role Scoper still supported? =

Yes, at this point I plan to keep Role Scoper compatible with upcoming WP versions and address future bug reports. However, Press Permit will receive support priority and most new functionality will be built around that plugin. This has proven to be a necessary move to fund development at this scale.

== Documentation ==

* A slightly outdated [Usage Guide](http://agapetry.net/downloads/RoleScoper_UsageGuide.htm) is available.  It includes both an overview of the permissions model and a How-To section with step by step directions.  Volunteer contributions to expand, revise or reformat this document are welcome.
* Role Scoper's menus, onscreen captions and inline descriptive footnotes [can be translated using poEdit](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/08/27/localizing-a-wordpress-plugin-using-poedit/).  I will gladly include any user-contributed languages!.

== Plugin Compatibility Issues ==

**WP Super Cache** : set WPSC option to disable caching for logged users (unless you only use Role Scoper to customize editing access).

**WPML Multilingual CMS** : plugin creates a separate post / page / category for each translation.  Role Scoper does not automatically synchronize role assignments or restrictions for new translations, but they can be set manually by an Administrator.  

**QTranslate** : Role Scoper ensures compatibility by disabling the caching of page and category listings.  To enable caching, change QTranslate get&#95;pages and get&#95;terms filter priority to 2 or higher, then add the following line to wp-config.php: `define('SCOPER_QTRANSLATE_COMPAT', true);`

**Get Recent Comments** : not compatible due to direct database query. Use WP Recent Comments widget instead.

**The Events Calendar** : Not compatible as of TEV 1.6.3.  For unofficial workaround, change the-events-calendar.class.php as follows :

change:

    add_filter( 'posts_join', array( $this, 'events_search_join' ) );
    add_filter( 'posts_where', array( $this, 'events_search_where' ) );
    add_filter( 'posts_orderby',array( $this, 'events_search_orderby' ) );
    add_filter( 'posts_fields',	array( $this, 'events_search_fields' ) );
    add_filter( 'post_limits', array( $this, 'events_search_limits' ) );
  
    
to:

    if( ! is_admin() ) {
      add_filter( 'posts_join', array( $this, 'events_search_join' ) );
      add_filter( 'posts_where', array( $this, 'events_search_where' ) );
      add_filter( 'posts_orderby',array( $this, 'events_search_orderby' ) );
      add_filter( 'posts_fields',	array( $this, 'events_search_fields' ) );
      add_filter( 'post_limits', array( $this, 'events_search_limits' ) );
    }
  
    
**PHP Execution** : as of v1.0.0, mechanism to limit editing based on post author capabilities is inherently incompatible w/ Role Scoper. Edit php-execution-plugin/includes/class.php_execution.php as follows :

change:

    add_filter('user_has_cap', array(&$this,'action_user_has_cap'),10,3);
  
    
to:

    add_filter( 'map_meta_cap', array( &$this,'map_meta_cap' ), 10, 4 );
    
replace function action_user_has_cap with :

    function map_meta_cap( $caps, $meta_cap, $user_id, $args ) {
        $object_id = ( is_array($args) ) ? $args[0] : $args;
        if ( ! $post = get_post( $object_id ) )
            return $caps;

        if ( function_exists( 'get_post_type_object' ) ) {
            $type_obj = get_post_type_object( $post->post_type );
            $is_edit_cap = ( ( $type_obj->cap->edit_post == $meta_cap ) && in_array( $type_obj->cap->edit_others_posts, $caps ) );
        } else {
            $is_edit_cap = in_array( $meta_cap, array( 'edit_post', 'edit_page' ) ) && array_intersect( $caps, array( 'edit_others_posts', 'edit_others_pages' ) );
        }

        if ( $is_edit_cap ) {
            $id = $post->post_author;

            if ( isset( $this->cap_cache[$id] ) ) {
                $author_can_exec_php = $this->cap_cache[$id];
            } else {
                $author = new WP_User($id);
                $author_can_exec_php = ! empty( $author->allcaps[PHP_EXECUTION_CAPABILITY] );
                $this->cap_cache[$id] = $author_can_exec_php;
            }

            if ( $author_can_exec_php ) 
                $caps []= PHP_EXECUTION_CAPABILITY;
        }

        return $caps;	
    }
    
== Attachment Filtering ==

Read access to uploaded file attachments is normally filtered to match post/page access.

To disable this attachment filtering, disable the option in Roles > Options or copy the following line to wp-config.php:
    define('DISABLE&#95;ATTACHMENT&#95;FILTERING', true);


To reinstate attachment filtering, remove the definition from wp-config.php and re-enable File Filtering via Roles > Options.

To fail with a null response when file access is denied (no WP 404 screen, but still includes a 404 in response header), copy the folling line to wp-config.php: 

    define ('SCOPER&#95;QUIET&#95;FILE&#95;404', true);
  
    
Normally, files which are in the uploads directory but have no post/page attachment will not be blocked.  To block such files, copy the following line to wp-config.php: 

    define('SCOPER&#95;BLOCK&#95;UNATTACHED&#95;UPLOADS', true);

== Hidden Content Teaser ==

The Hidden Content Teaser may be configured to display the first X characters of a post/page if no excerpt or more tag is available.

To specify the number of characters (default is 50), copy the following line to wp-config.php:
 
    define('SCOPER&#95;TEASER&#95;NUM&#95;CHARS', 100); // set to any number of your choice
