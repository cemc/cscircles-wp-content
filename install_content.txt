If you are seeking to make a complete clone of the CS Circles site, this
requires contacting us for permission. We will give you a file called something
like computersciencecircles.wordpress.yyyy-mm-dd.xml and these are the steps
needed to install its contents.


Installing CS Circles Content

- Get latest cscircles repo ("git pull")

- Plugins->Installed Plugins: activate Python in a Box, Polylang, LaTeX, WordPress Importer if not already activated

- Important! Make sure all 4 of the plugins just mentioned are activated.

- double-check that pybox 2011 child theme is activated (see README.md)

File Import

The wordpress mechanism requires uploading the .xml file first, which needs a directory permission.

- create wp-content/uploads and make it webserver writeable (either chmod a+rw it, or sudo chgrp apache it followed by chmod g+rw)

- go to Tools->Import->WordPress, upload the .xml file

- Assign all posts to your admin account; not necessary to import attachments

- ignore errors (related to attachments/images, not important)

Settings

- Settings->Reading, change front page to "0: Hello!"

- Settings->Languages->Settings Tab, (i) set default language to English (ii) turn off "Detect browser language"

- Appearance->Menus, pick the English menu, at bottom check "Primary Menu English"

- [admin menu in top, 3 spots from right]->"Rebuild Databases", press button (you should see lots of output)

Check if it worked:

- [user menu in top right corner]->"My progress" 

You should see about 100 exercises grouped by lesson. Try solving some problems and visit it again.


Offline LaTeX (optional)

- Go to Settings -> WP LaTeX

- create wp-content/latex (same instructions as above for "wp-content/uploads")

- switch from the server to dvipng or dvips+convert

- check out Geometric Mean and Gravity in lesson 7b to see if it is showing formulas
