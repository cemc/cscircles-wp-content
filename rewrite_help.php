  // To see info about your PHP configuration,

  // (1) uncomment this line

  //   phpinfo();

  // (2) visit this file in a browser, it will be somewhere like
  // http://your-site/cscircles/wp-content/rewrite_help.php

  // The "Loaded Modules" section will tell you
  // whether mod_rewrite is installed.

  // If it's not installed, we achieved this by uncommenting
  // the line "LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so"
  // in "/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf" but your server may vary.
  // See also this link on locating the config:
  //  http://serverfault.com/questions/155113/ 
  // Remember to restart the http server process after changing 
  // the config.
