Correct! Here is one way to arrive at this answer. First, <code>not (A or B)</code> is only true when both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are false. Also, note that <code>(not A) and (not B)</code> is only true if both <code>not A</code> and <code>not B</code> are true, i.e. if both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are false. So we have the following equality:<pre>(not A) and (not B) = not (A or B)</pre>Put a <code>not</code> around both sides, so we deduce<pre>not ((not A) and (not B)) = not (not (A or B))</pre>and observe that <code>not(not X))</code> always equals <code>X</code>, so<pre>not ((not A) and (not B)) = not (not (A or B)) = A or B</pre>This way of rewriting a boolean expression is one of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws'>De Morgan&#39;s laws</a>.
