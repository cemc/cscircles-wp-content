There are two kinds of source files here, and .png
files used on the website.

(1) PDF files, created by IPE.
Run the convert.sh in each directory to render them.

(2) PPTX files, created by Microsoft PowerPoint.
You have to render these manually in Windows... you
can export to .png and then crop them manually, this
gives the right size (there are only 2 such files).

If you're translating, feel free to leave some of this
to Dave, but editing the PDFs in IPE yourself helps a 
lot. In Lesson 17 make sure the text fits inside the boxes
or change all slides uniformly otherwise. If you do
change things in such a way that affects the image size,
make sure you also edit the height attribute of the img
tags in lesson 17, otherwise the slides won't show
correctly.
